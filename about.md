I've always kept a fairly low profile on the web, but I often advocate that your internet presence can be one of your most valuable assets personally and professionally. It's as simple as sharing your thoughts and experiences with the rest of the world. Here's me finally taking my own advice.

## Background

I was born and raised in California, but now call New Zealand my home. I work for <a href="http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html">a very untraditional company</a> doing what I love &mdash; web development.

I spent a lot of my childhood and teenage years immersed in the internet, learning as much as I could about building websites, creating wealth, and growing as a person.

Being an introvert and an observer, I've internalized much of this advice and knowledge. As an exercise in extraversion, and for personal record keeping and memory management, I've created this personal space to document what I've learned along the way.
